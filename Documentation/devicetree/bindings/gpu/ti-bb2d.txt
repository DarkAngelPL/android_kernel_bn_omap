* Texas Instruments BB2D blitter module

BB2D is a 2D blitter module available in Texas Instruments SoC's to
accelerate 2D blitting operations. This binding describes the BB2D
module integration to the device tree framework.

Require properties:
  - compatible: value should take the following format:
        "ti,<soc>-bb2d"

  - reg : base address and length of BB2D IP registers
  - interrupts : BB2D interrupt line number
  - ti,hwmods : name of the hwmod associated with BB2D module
  - clocks : form SoC clock binding: handle to module clocks

Optional properties:
  - reg-names : names of registers listed in reg property in same order
  - clock-names : names of clocks listed in clocks property in same order

Example for DRA7x SoC:
        bb2d: bb2d@59000000 {
            compatible = "ti,dra7-bb2d";
            reg = <0x59000000 0x0700>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 120 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            ti,hwmods = "bb2d";
            clocks = <&dpll_core_h24x2_ck>;
            clock-names = "fck";
        };
